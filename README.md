This Python script utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create a visually appealing pattern of colored dots on the canvas. Each dot is painted with a randomly selected color from a predefined list of RGB values.

## Overview

The code sets up a Turtle graphics window and positions the turtle to start painting dots in a grid pattern. The colors for the dots are chosen randomly from a list of RGB color values. The script uses loops and Turtle graphics commands to create a visually appealing composition.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dots-painting-code.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dots-painting-code
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python dots_painting_code.py
    ```

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the `color_list` variable to include your preferred RGB colors. Additionally, you can adjust the size of the dots, the number of dots, and the spacing between dots to create different visual effects.
